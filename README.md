Hi I am dozersdad, why dozersdad, because my son is called a bulldozer on the rugby pitch. Front row if you know rugby.
I have been in the silicon chip design industry for 35 years, architecting, designing, verification and testing. From 10 micron to 7 nanometers. 
I am now interested in the development of software, one cannot design silicon chips if you are not proficient in software.
After jumping off the bleeding edge, I want to develop applications that do not exist.
I would talk with anyone interested in apps for the working class community, tradesmen etc, there is a complete hole there. Even hardware.
to reach me, I am dozersdad9@gmail.com.
